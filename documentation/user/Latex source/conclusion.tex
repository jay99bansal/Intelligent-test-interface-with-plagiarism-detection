So, we have successfully created a plagiarism detecting tool for institutes/instructors. They just need to host a test and wait for the responses, and the python script will do the index calculating job. \\ \\
We have analyzed all the string matching algorithms in depth and created one for this purpose on our own too, without the help of any supporting libraries. The instructor can adjust the weights of all the algorithms in order to see the effect of various algorithms on different types of tests.\\ \\
Cosine similarity(word) metric which we created on our own showed best results for plagiarism index in large or small strings, which was a great success for our research(to come up with a modification in existing technique and get better results for a set of problems than existing techniques). \\ \\
This interface will accomplish a healthy cheat-free environment among students.
